\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}

An initial outline of how process model forecasting can be achieved was presented by \cite{DBLP:conf/bpm/PollPRRR18}.

Various predictive techniques exist, many coined under the term of predictive process monitoring []...


Contributions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Propose the first process model-wide forecasting technique, which fits the the broader area of predictive process monitoring.
	\item To this purpose, a variety of time series analysis techniques are applied to 3 real-life event logs with two event log aggregations that establish suitable time series. They predict the level of directly-follows occurrences for activity pairs over time.
	\item A variety of considerations regarding the use of time series analysis for event logs are discussed, as wel as the suitability of other predictive algorithms.
	\item Results show that...
