\begin{abstract}
The surge in event data recorded during the execution of business processes is ever-growing and has spurred an array of data-driven process analytics to support and improve how the business processes are performed.
A major strand of such analytics encompasses forecasting how the business processes will unfold into the future, mainly focusing on the next-step, remaining time, and goal-oriented predictions.
The granularity of such approaches lies with the individual events in the process.
In contrast, this work approaches process forecasting at a larger scale and proposes a technique to forecast the entire process model from the available historical event data.
A forecasted model summarizes the anticipated business processes and can be used by process analysts to prepare for the upcoming global and longer-term changes, such as impending process drifts or emerging performance bottlenecks.
To this purpose, event data is reshaped into multiple time series, each representing an evolution of a behavioural aspect of the process model, and collectively specifying the historical evolution of the model.
We then perform time series forecasting to extrapolate the individual series and, concomitantly, the entire model into the future.
Experiments confirm that this approach is capable of informing process analysts about the future evolution of the business processes.

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper we investigated the potential of using time series forecasting for process model monitoring.

In future research we will cover more intricate forecasting techniques and compare with machine learning-based models.
Furthermore, we will perform an extensive prediction confidence interval analysis.
