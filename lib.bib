@article{Xie2017,
abstract = {A keyphrase (a multi-word unit) in a document denotes one or multiple keywords capturing a main topic of the underlying document. Finding good keyphrases of a document can quickly summarize knowledge for efficient decision making and benefit domains involving intensive text information. To date, existing keyphrase extraction methods cannot be customized to each specific document, mainly because their patterns used to form paraphrases are too restrictive and may not capture flexible keyword relationships inside the text. In this paper, we propose a sequential pattern mining based document-specific keyphrase extraction method. Our key innovation is to use wildcards (or gap constraints) to help extract sequential patterns, so the flexible wildcard constraints within a pattern can capture semantic relationships between words, and the system will have full flexibility to discover different types of sequential patterns as candidates for keyphrase extraction. To achieve the goal, we regard each single document as a sequential dataset, and propose an efficient algorithm to mine sequential patterns with wildcard and one-off conditions that allows important keyphrases to be captured during the mining process. For each extracted keyphrase candidate, we use some statistical pattern features to characterize it, and further collect all keyphrases from the document to form a training set. A supervised learning classifier is trained to identify keyphrases from a test document. Because our pattern mining and pattern characterization processes are customized to each single document, keyphases extracted from our method are highly specific for each document. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed sequential pattern mining method outperforms existing pattern mining methods in both runtime performance and completeness. Comparisons on keyphrase benchmark datasets also confirm that the proposed document-specific keyphrase extraction method is effective in improving the quality of extracted keyphrases.},

abstract = {The term Decision Mining has been put forward in literature to cover numerous applications in a diverse set of contexts. In the business process management community, it typically reflects the way processes and data required for decision purposes in those processes are blended into one model during discovery. However, the upcoming field of decision modeling and management requires the term to be repositioned in order to obtain a better understanding of the interplay of processes and decisions. In this paper, the different approaches that are currently available are delineated and a case is made for a new type of decision mining: one that separates the control flow and decision perspective in a less stringent form compared to existing approaches.},

abstract = {Context: Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is the de facto standard for business process modeling. It was developed by the Object Management Group with support of the major organizations in the fields of software engineering and information systems. Despite its wide use, when it comes to representing ubiquitous business processes, this business process modeling language is lacking. Objective: To address BPMN's deficiency in representing ubiquitous business processes, we extend it and present uBPMN (or ubiquitous BPMN). Method: First, we analyze the modeling requirements for representing ubiquitous business processes. Based on the requirements, we conservatively extend the Meta-Object Facility meta-model and the XML Schema Definition of BPMN as well as extend the notation. The extension, that we call uBPMN follows the same outline as set by the Object Management Group for BPMN. Results: The proposed uBPMN not only allows for modeling ubiquitous business processes but also lays the groundwork for potentially deploying a variety of ubiquitous computing technologies. We illustrate all of uBPMN's capabilities and benefits with real-life examples. Conclusion: uBPMN extends BPMN v2.0 with new capabilities to deal with ubiquitous computing technologies.},

abstract = {Sequential pattern mining is an important data-mining method for determining time-related behavior in sequence databases. The information obtained from sequential pattern mining can be used in marketing, medical records, sales analysis, and so on. Existing methods only focus on the concept of frequency because of the assumption that sequences' behaviors do not change over time. The environment from which the data is generated is often dynamic, however, so the sequences' behaviors may change over time. To adapt the discovered patterns to these changes, two new concepts, recency and compactness, are incorporated into traditional sequential pattern mining. The concept of recency causes patterns to quickly adapt to the latest behaviors in sequence databases, while the concept of compactness ensures reasonable time spans for the discovered patterns. We named the new patterns CFR-patterns because three concepts (compactness, frequency, and recency) are simultaneously considered. An efficient method is presented to find CFR-patterns. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed methods are computationally efficient and that they are more advantageous than traditional methods when sequences' behaviors change over time. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

We describe a framework to improve existing ontology mappings using a Bayesian Network. Omen, an Ontology Mapping ENhancer uses a set of meta-rules that capture the influence of the ontology structure and the semantics of ontology relations and matches nodes that are neighbors of already matched nodes in the two ontologies. We have implemented a protype ontology matcher that can enhance existing matches between ontology concepts. Preliminary experiments demonstrate that Omen successfully identifies and enhances ontology mappings. 1},

@article{Lo2008,
abstract = {Specification mining is a process of extracting specifications, often from program execution traces. These specifications can in turn be used to aid program understanding, monitoring and verification. There are a number of dynamic-analysis-based specification mining tools in the literature, however none so far extract past time temporal expressions in the form of rules stating: "whenever a series of events occurs, previously another series of events has happened". Rules of this format are commonly found in practice and useful for various purposes. Most rule-based specification mining tools only mine future-time temporal expression. Many past-time temporal rules like "whenever a resource is used, it was allocated before" are asymmetric as the other direction does not holds. Hence, there is a need to mine past-time temporal rules. In this paper, we describe an approach to mine significant rules of the above format occurring above a certain statistical thresholds from program execution traces. The approach start from a set of traces, each being a sequence of events (i.e., method invocations) and resulting in a set of significant rules obeying minimum thresholds of support and confidence. A rule compaction mechanism is employed to reduce the number of reported rules significantly. Experiments on traces of JBoss Application Server shows the utility of our approach in inferring interesting past-time temporal rules.},

abstract = {Bitcoin, the famous peer-to-peer, decentralized electronic currency system, allows users to benefit from pseudonymity, by generating an arbitrary number of aliases (or addresses) to move funds. However, the complete history of all transactions ever performed, called ``blockchain'', is public and replicated on each node. The data it contains is difficult to analyze manually, but can yield a high number of relevant information. In this paper we present a modular framework, BitIodine, which parses the blockchain, clusters addresses that are likely to belong to a same user or group of users, classifies such users and labels them, and finally visualizes complex information extracted from the Bitcoin network. BitIodine labels users semi-automatically with information on their identity and actions which is automatically scraped from openly available information sources. BitIodine also supports manual investigation by finding paths and reverse paths between addresses or users. We tested BitIodine on several real-world use cases, identified an address likely to belong to the encrypted Silk Road cold wallet, or investigated the CryptoLocker ransomware and accurately quantified the number of ransoms paid, as well as information about the victims. We release a prototype of BitIodine as a library for building Bitcoin forensic analysis tools.},

@article{Chang2011,
abstract = {Sequential pattern mining, including weighted sequential pattern mining, has been attracting much attention since it is one of the essential data mining tasks with broad applications. The weighted sequential pattern mining aims to find more interesting sequential patterns, considering the different significance of each data element in a sequence database. In the conventional weighted sequential pattern mining, usually pre-assigned weights of data elements are used to get the importance, which are derived from their quantitative information and their importance in real world application domains. In general sequential pattern mining, the generation order of data elements is considered to find sequential patterns. However, their generation times and time-intervals are also important in real world application domains. Therefore, time-interval information of data elements can be helpful in finding more interesting sequential patterns. This paper presents a new framework for finding time-interval weighted sequential (TiWS) patterns in a sequence database and time-interval weighted support (TiW-support) to find the TiWS patterns. In addition, a new method of mining TiWS patterns in a sequence database is also presented. In the proposed framework of TiWS pattern mining, the weight of each sequence in a sequence database is first obtained from the time-intervals of elements in the sequence, and subsequently TiWS patterns are found considering the weight. A series of evaluation results shows that TIWS pattern mining is efficient and helpful in finding more interesting sequential patterns. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {While a number of efficient sequential pattern mining algorithms were developed over the years, they can still take a long time and produce a huge number of patterns, many of which are redundant. These properties are especially frustrating when the goal of pattern mining is to find patterns for use as features in classification problems. In this paper, we describe BIDE-Discriminative, amodification of BIDE that uses class information for direct mining of predictive sequential patterns. We then perform an extensive evaluation on nine real-life datasets of the different ways in which the basic BIDE-Discriminative can be used in real multi-class classification problems, including 1-versus-rest and model-based search tree approaches. The results of our experiments show that 1-versus-rest provides an efficient solution with good classification performance.},

@article{Anderl2014,
abstract = {Advertisers employ various channels to reach customers over the Internet, who often get in touch with multiple channels along their "customer journey." However, evaluating the degree to which each channel contributes to marketing success and the ways in which channels influence one another remains challenging. Although advanced attribution models have been introduced in academia and practice alike, generalizable insights on channel effectiveness in multichannel settings, and on the interplay of channels, are still lacking. In response, the authors introduce a novel attribution framework reflecting the sequential nature of customer paths as first- and higher-order Markov walks. Applying this framework to four large customer-level data sets from various industries, each entailing at least seven distinct online channels, allows for deriving empirical generalizations and industry-related insights. The results show substantial differences from currently applied heuristics such as last click attribution, confirming and refining previous research on singular data sets. Moreover, the authors identify idiosyncratic channel preferences (carryover) and interaction effects both within and across channel categories (spillover). In this way, the study can help advertisers develop integrated online marketing strategies.},

@article{DeSmedt2018,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Elsevier Ltd. Flexible systems and services require a solid approach for modeling and enacting dynamic behavior. Declarative process models gained plenty of traction lately as they have proven to provide a good fit for the problem at hand, i.e. visualizing and executing flexible business processes. These models are based on constraints that impose behavioral restrictions on process behavior. Essentially, a declarative model is a set of constraints defined over the set of activities in a process. While allowing for very flexible process specifications, a major downside is that the combination of constraints can lead to behavioral restrictions not explicitly visible when reading a model. These restrictions, so-called hidden dependencies, make the models much more difficult to understand. This paper presents a technique for discovering hidden dependencies and making them explicit by means of dependency structures. Experiments with novice process modelers demonstrate that the proposed technique lowers the cognitive effort necessary to comprehend a constraint-based process model.},

@inproceedings{iBPM,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG. In this paper we present the interesting Behavioral Constraint Miner (iBCM), a new approach towards classifying sequences. The prevalence of sequential data, i.e., a collection of ordered items such as text, website navigation patterns, traffic management, and so on, has incited a surge in research interest towards sequence classification. Existing approaches mainly focus on retrieving sequences of itemsets and checking their presence in labeled data streams to obtain a classifier. The proposed iBCM approach, rather than focusing on plain sequences, is template-based and draws its inspiration from behavioral patterns used for software verification. These patterns have a broad range of characteristics and go beyond the typical sequence mining representation, allowing for a more precise and concise way of capturing sequential information in a database. Furthermore, it is possible to also mine for negative information, i.e., sequences that do not occur. The technique is benchmarked against other state-of-the-art approaches and exhibits a strong potential towards sequence classification. Code related to this chapter is available at: http://feb.kuleuven.be/public/u0092789/.},

@article{Meroni17,
abstract = {Nowadays, many business processes once intra-organizational are becoming inter-organizational. Thus, being able to monitor how such processes are performed, including portions carried out by service providers, is paramount. Yet, traditional process moni-toring techniques present some shortcomings when dealing with inter-organizational processes. In particular, they require human operators to notify when business activities are performed, and to stop the process when it is not executed as expected. In this paper, we address these issues by proposing an artifact-driven monitoring service, capable of autonomously and continuously monitor inter-organizational processes. To do so, this service relies on the state of the artifacts (i.e., physi-cal entities) participating to the process, represented using the E-GSM notation. A working prototype of this service is presented and validated using real-world processes and data from the logistics domain.},

abstract = {This paper presents our ongoing effort on developing a principled methodology for automatic ontology mapping based on BayesOWL, a probabilistic framework we developed for modeling uncertainty in semantic web. In this approach, the source and target ontologies are first translated into Bayesian networks (BN); the concept mapping between the two ontologies are treated as evidential reasoning between the two translated BNs. Probabilities needed for constructing conditional probability tables (CPT) during translation and for measuring semantic similarity during mapping are learned using text classification techniques where each concept in an ontology is associated with a set of semantically relevant text documents, which are obtained by ontology guided web mining. The basic ideas of this approach are validated by positive results from computer experiments on two small real-world ontologies.},

abstract = {We tackle the time-series classification problem using a novel probabilistic model that represents the conditional densities of the observed sequences being time-warped and transformed from an underlying base sequence. We call it probabilistic sequence translation-alignment model (PSTAM) since it aims to capture both feature alignment and mapping between sequences, analogous to translating one language into another in the field of machine translation. To deal with general time-series, we impose the time-monotonicity constraints on the hidden alignment variables in the model parameter space, where by marginalizing them out it allows effective learning of class-specific time-warping and feature transformation simultaneously. Our PSTAM, thus, naturally enjoys the advantages from two typical approaches widely used in sequence classification: 1) benefits from the alignment-based methods that aim to estimate distance measures between non-equal-length sequences via direct comparison of aligned features, and 2) merits of the model-based approaches that can effectively capture the class-specific patterns or trends. Furthermore, the low-dimensional modeling of the latent base sequence naturally provides a way to discover the intrinsic manifold structure possibly retained in the observed data, leading to an unsupervised manifold learning for sequence data. The benefits of the proposed approach are demonstrated on a comprehensive set of evaluations with both synthetic and real-world sequence data sets.},

abstract = {Separating the decision modelling concern from the processes modelling concern has gained significant support in literature over the past few years, as incorporating both concerns into a single model has shown to impair the scalability, maintainability, flexibility and understandability of both processes and decisions. Most notably the introduction of the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard by the Object Management Group has provided a suitable solution for externalising decisions from processes. This paper introduces a systematic way of tackling the separation of the decision modelling concern from process modelling by providing a Decision as a Service (DaaS) layered Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) which approaches decisions as externalised services that processes need to invoke on demand in order to obtain the decision outcome. Additionally, the benefits of the DaaS design on process-decision modelling are discussed in terms of scalability, maintainability, flexibility and understandability.},

abstract="Most information systems supporting operational processes also record event logs. These can be used to diagnose performance and compliance problems. The majority of process mining techniques extract models that are descriptive and describe what happened in the past. Few process mining techniques discover models that allow us to ``look into the future'' and perform predictive analyses. Recently, novel approaches have been developed for scenario-based prediction, i.e., predicting the effects of process changes on process performance, e.g., investing in an additional resource. To work accurately, the techniques need an appropriate time step-size, the selection of which, thus far, has been an ad-hoc and manual endeavor. Therefore, in this paper, building upon time-series analysis and forecasting techniques, we propose a novel semi-automated time-granularity detection framework. Our framework detects the best possible time-granularity to be used, whilst taking user preferences into account. Our evaluation, using both real and synthetic data, confirms the feasibility of our approach and highlights the importance of using accurate granularity in time step selection.",
