\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we presented the first technique for process model forecasting. To this end, we developed a
technique based on time series analysis to forecast the entire process model from historical event data. In this way, we are able to capture process drifts in an accurate way, as demonstrated in our evaluation using our Process Change Exploration system. 

In future research, we plan to evaluate alternative machine learning techniques for process model prediction. Furthermore, we want to explore opportunities for enriching our forecasted process models with confidence intervals. Finally, we will conduct design studies with process analysts to evaluate the usability of different visualization techniques.
